## :bangbang: This plugin is deprecated :bangbang:

As Matomo 3.8.0-b3 two factor authentication is integrated in core. Updating Matomo will automatically disable this plugin and migrate already setup 2FA settings.


## Description

Adds a userbased possibility to use Google Authenticator 2FA as additional login security.
Each use can enable/disable this feature in his account settings.

This Plugin is based on the original Piwik Login plugin and needs this one to be installed but not active.

ATTENTION: Activating Google Authenticator for an account, also requires an auth code for direct API requests with the users token auth. Use ```&auth_code={authcode}``` to do that.

Applications accessing your Piwik data using the API might thus no longer work. This also affects all versions of Piwik Mobile. To avoid this create a read only user account in Piwik to use it in those applications.

### Requirements

[Piwik](https://github.com/piwik/piwik) 3.6.0 or higher is required.

Google Authenticator App for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) or [Blackberry](https://m.google.com/authenticator) needs to be [installed](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=de) on your mobile device
